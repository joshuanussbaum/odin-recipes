# odin-recipes
First real project for The Odin Project!

Pre-Project: This is a practice project to demonstrate proficiency with HTML. Later on, it will be updated to include CSS! I should be able to utilize HTML tags, create folder hierarchies within the system, and reference different files across the folder hierarchy!
