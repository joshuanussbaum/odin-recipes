    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds Boneless Pork Shoulder or Pork Butt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Granulated White Sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Five Spice Powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon White Pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing Rice Wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Hoising Sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Molasses</li>
        <li>3 cloves Garlic, Minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Hot Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the pork into strips or chunks about 2-3 inches thick, leaving fat on.</li>
        <li>In a small or medium sized bowl, combine sugar, salt, five spice, white pepper, sesame oil, rice wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, molasses, and minced garlic.</li>
        <li>Reserve about 2 tablespoons of marinade, then in a large bowl or baking dish rub the pork with the remaining marinade. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 8 hours (overnight works best). Do the same for the reserved marinade.</li>
        <li>Place rack in the upper third of your oven, and preheat oven to 475F (245C).</li>
        <li>Line a sheet pan with foil and place a metal rack on top. Pour 1 1/2 cups water into the pan. Place the pork on rack, leaving as much space between pieces as possible.</li>
        <li>Transfer pork to the preheated oven. Roast for 25 minutes, reducing the oven temperature to 375F (190C) after 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pork, and carefully rotate the pan 180 degrees. If the bottom of the pan is dry, add another cup of water. Roast for another 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine the reserved marinade with honey and 1 tablespoon hot water.</li>
        <li>After 40 minutes of total roasting time, baste the pork, flip it, and baste the other side. Roast for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>For crispy pork, broil for no more than 5 minutes. Pork is ready when it looks sticky and caramelized, but not burnt. Internal temperature should read at least 145F (62C).</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and baste with any leftover marinade. Rest for 10 minutes, slice, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
