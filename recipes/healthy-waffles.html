    <h1>High Protein/High Fiber Waffles</h1>
    <img src="../img/waffles.jpg">
    <p>This waffle recipe is packed with extra protein and fiber; perfect for indulgent breakfasts with less guilt!</p>
    <p>Don't have a waffle maker? Skip the last three steps and pour silver dollar-sized dollops onto a buttered skillet over medium heat. Wait until bubbles form and pop on top side and bottom of pancakes come off the skillet easily, then flip and cook until both sides are a golden brown color - approximately 3 minutes per side.</p>
